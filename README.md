## General Information

Brock Visual TimeTable is a tool created by Brock students for Brock students. The goal of this project is to simplify and enhance the way students plan their academic schedules. With a clean user-friendly interface this tool allows students to quickly & visually map out their lectures, seminars, tutorials, and labs by simply typing in their course codes. This tool is especially beneficial for first-year students who are unfamiliar with the complexities of university scheduling.
