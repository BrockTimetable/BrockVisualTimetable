                    All available options for one or more course components conflict with your current time constraints,
                    meaning the chosen class overlaps with your blocked time slots. Consequently, registering for this
                    schedule will result in a class during one of your blocked time periods. Please ensure you are
                    available for the generated timetable prior to registering.

                    1. Adjust your blocked time slots: Consider unblocking certain time slots to increase scheduling
                    flexibility.

                    times.
